This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Ru*

```{r}
library(foreign)  ## for: read.dta
## do not use haven::read_dta since this messes up `udat$type` factor labels
library(tidyverse)

library(survival)
```

*n* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*.

```{r}
set.seed(1)
wage_data<- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lilyhuong/Advanced_econometrics_R/main/dataset-21901.csv", header = TRUE)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
